                        <p>I am a highly personable and enthusiastic career changer who thrives on <span class="keywords">problem solving</span> and <span class="keywords">collaboration</span>, with a focus on building full stack web applications using <span class="keywords">JavaScript, React, Express</span> and using <span class="keywords">RESTful API </span>methods.</p>
                        <p>After a successful career as a <span class="keywords">graphic designer </span>and <span class="keywords">project manager</span>, I realised I needed a change. My choice of coding and software development was influenced by childhood nostalgia of tinkering with oscilloscopes and circuit boards, along with an love of STEM subjects and puzzle-solving.</p>
                        <p>During my time as an <span class="keywords">Junior Instructor at CodeClan</span>, I found genuine satisfaction in melding my own learning with student learning. I embraced the challenge of <span class="keywords">researching</span> and conveying complex concepts into <span class="keywords">bite-sized, original</span> and <span class="keywords">understandable lessons</span>. My ability to help students grow their self-confidence was vital for their success. Every day was unique, whether it was <span class="keywords">mentoring or collaborating</span> with students and colleagues, or increasing my knowledge to design <span class="keywords">scalable and maintainable web applications</span>. The dynamic environment constantly exposed me to new technologies and resources, driving my <span class="keywords">self-development</span>.</p>
